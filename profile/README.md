> [!NOTE]
> Please note that if you are joining this organization, we do have some requirements aside from usage of our services.
>
> As we work together on our organization's repositories, sites, apps, and data, we have established a set of guidelines to ensure a smooth and productive experience for everyone.
>
> These guidelines are designed to be straightforward and easy to follow and are not meant to be burdensome, but rather to ensure we adhere to best practices and maintain the high quality of our work.
>
> Please note that we value the contributions of all its members, regardless of age. However, we simply require that all developers be at least **13 years of age** with very few exceptions. This is to ensure that they have reached a level of maturity and responsibility necessary for the role.
>
> Secondly, for those who are under **16 years old**, or **18 in countries outside of North and South America**, we require **consent or permission from a parent or guardian**. This is to ensure that the responsibilities of being a developer align with their other commitments and well-being.
>
> While we greatly appreciate the enthusiasm of our younger members, it's important for our developers to have the ability to contribute consistently. This helps us maintain the quality and reliability of our projects.

We hope these guidelines are clear and we look forward to your contributions in the future, whether as a user or developer.
